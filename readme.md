# SoftGelPills Project
We are interns at SoftGel Pills for Health.
Our Company wants to revamp their entire system from the ground up.
We have been assigned this project, we will focus on laying the groundwork for the system and getting comfortable working in our team.

# Our task
The executives want us to create two types of pills, AcheAway and Dreamly.
Each pill should have a name, strength in mg, size in mm, color, casing material, aqueous solution, and active ingredient.
We organize ourselves with a kanban board on Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/RA6BbxV5/cs3667-pills-pt1).

# Our team
Our team is formally known as Group 2; informally, we are Scrim Scram Scrum.
Our names are Solace, Riley, Eli, and Hermes.
